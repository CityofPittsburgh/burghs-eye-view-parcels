				<p><em>At first glance,</em> Burgh&rsquo;s Eye View might seem like some&shy;thing from the dreams of our most &ldquo;neb&shy;by&rdquo; neigh&shy;bors. For the first time, you can easi&shy;ly see all kinds of data about Pitts&shy;burgh&mdash;includ&shy;ing 311 re&shy;quests, build&shy;ing permits, code violat&shy;ions, and pub&shy;lic safe&shy;ty in&shy;ci&shy;dents.</p>
				<p>But City data isn&rsquo;t a log of when and where we put our park&shy;ing chairs. It&rsquo;s a huge col&shy;lect&shy;ion of in&shy;form&shy;ation about the world a&shy;round us that can help us under&shy;stand what&rsquo;s happen&shy;ing in our neigh&shy;bor&shy;hoods, and lead us to ideas and decis&shy;ions that can make where we live bet&shy;ter. We think of it as neb&shy;by for the great&shy;er good.</p>
				<p>So, whether you&rsquo;re look&shy;ing at in&shy;form&shy;at&shy;ion about side&shy;walks that need re&shy;pair&shy;ing, or map&shy;ping out street&shy;lights that are a lit&shy;tle too dim, re&shy;mem&shy;ber: While data can help us know, its high&shy;est pur&shy;pose is to help us join to&shy;get&shy;her with other re&shy;sid&shy;ents and the City to make change.</p>

				<h3>Ok, so how do I use it?</h3>
				<p>Burgh&rsquo;s Eye View uses a map to visualize data generated by the City of Pittsburgh and its residents. As you play with it&mdash;changing the date range, for example&mdash;what you see on the map will change. You can scroll to zoom or use the +/- buttons at the top left, click on pins to see details, and move the map around using a mouse or touch.</p>
				<p>But the key to the City data is the gray panel on the left&mdash;or under the + next to search on mobile:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Search</dt>
					<dd>You can search for a specific address or block, as well as other keywords in some of the data. But keep in mind that a lot of location information is generalized to the block or neighborhood level in order to protect people's privacy. Some sensitive datasets don't have addresses at all, and so will not react to address searches.</dd>
					<dt>Dates</dt>
					<dd>Most information on Burgh&rsquo;s Eye View has a date attached to it. Change the date range to see things from a certain day, week, month, or any period you&rsquo;re interested in.</dd>
					<dt>Data</dt>
					<dd>Using these checkboxes, you can turn off datasets to get a clearer view of what you're interested in. Some datasets have specific filters just for them. You can set those filters in the fields below each checkbox.</dd>
					<dt>"Filter by Area"</dt>
					<dd>Are you interested in looking at information for a particular neighborhood, Council district, Police zone, or Public Works division? Select the type of area you want to see&mdash;the default is Neighborhood&mdash;and then you can set the specific area or areas below that. As with Search, some datasets' locations are generalized and may not react to these filters.</dd>

				<h3>And what data can I find on it?</h3>
				<p>You can learn a lot using Burgh&rsquo;s Eye View. So much that we won&rsquo;t list everything&mdash;just to save our breath. But here are some of the things you can find, along with links to the source data and other resources:</p>
				
				<h5>311 Requests</h5>
				<p>This layer allows you to see <a target="_blank" href="https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/311-data">311 requests</a>, which are non-emergency concerns or questions that residents send to the City using the 311 call center, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Pgh311">social media</a>, text message, <a target="_blank" href="http://pittsburghpa.gov/311/form">the website</a>, or the myBurgh apps for <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/myburgh/id1021606996?mt=8">iOS</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qscend.report2gov.myburgh&hl=en">Android</a>. As you can imagine, residents have a wide range of concerns and questions. Start typing in the &ldquo;Request Type&rdquo; box to select the types of requests you want to see on the map. You can also view requests that are assigned to specific City departments or agencies, and view requests by origin (whether they were submitted as a call, on social media, etc). Click any of the orange icons on the map to learn more about a specific 311 request.</p>
				
				<h5>Public Safety Information</h5>
				<p>These layers allow you to see incidents captured in <a target="_blank" href="https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/police-incident-blotter">the 30-day police blotter</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data">the police blotter archive</a> as well as non-identifying information on <a target="_blank" href="https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data">arrests</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/non-traffic-citations">non-traffic citations</a>. Use the Hierarchy field to find specific types of crimes. Click on any of the blue, red, or pink icons on the map to learn more about a specific public safety incident.</p>
				
				<h5>Building Information</h5>
				<p>These layers allow you to see information on <a target="_blank" href="https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-pli-violations-report">violations</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-facilities-centroids">city facilities</a>. Select or start typing in the &ldquo;Violation,&rdquo; &ldquo;Inspection Result,&rdquo; &ldquo;Next Action,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Facility Usage&rdquo; fields to narrow down or view specific results. Click on any of the blue, green, or gray icons on the map to learn more about a specific permit, violation, or facility.</p>

				<h3>Wait, why are things where they are?</h3>
				<p>Markers or &ldquo;pins&rdquo; for each dataset show up on the map differently depending on the source. Public Safety pins are geocoded by the block or intersection of the incident or arrest using Allegheny County's geocoder, every night. Building permits and code violations are geocoded at the center of their respective parcel id, which is determined by Allegheny County. 311 Requests are first geocoded by the City's 311 request tracking system. To maintain citizens' privacy these requests are then specially obfuscated. This process is handled by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wprdc.org/">Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center</a>, and they describe it this way:</p>
				<blockquote>For some less-sensitive request types, actual coordinates appear in the 311 open data. For more sensitive requests, coordinates representing the approximate location of the complaint are shared to protect the identity of the person making the complaint. The data file indicates whether exact or approximate coordinates have been included.</blockquote>

				<h3>Wow, is there more like this?</h3>
				<p>Whenever possible, Burgh&rsquo;s Eye View will point you to other resources for the data or information you are viewing. This includes links to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www2.county.allegheny.pa.us/RealEstate/Search.aspx">Allegheny County Real Estate Portal</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://pittsburghpa.gov/311/form">311 Request Online Form</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://registerparks.pittsburghpa.gov/">City Online Facility Rental</a> page. All of these resources are available 24/7, just like Burgh&rsquo;s Eye View.</p>
				<p>This page has lots of links to other City data, information and resources, and you can find more at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/">pittsburghpa.gov</a> or by following the city on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/CityPGH">Twitter</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/city.of.pittsburgh/">Facebook</a>.</p>
				<p>And yes there are more projects like this to come! You can write to the team that built this at <a href="mailto:analytics@pittsburghpa.gov">analytics@pittsburghpa.gov</a>. We'd love to hear your feedback, ideas, and hopes for the future of data in the City of Pittsburgh. (But please note that we may not be able to respond individually.)</p>
